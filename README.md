# Discovering-Image-Clusters-in-STL10

This repository is part of the finals for Advanced Machine Learning. The goal of this project is to explore hidden patterns and structure in images using unsupervised learning techniques. We work with the unlabeled STL‑10 dataset, which contains a diverse set of natural images.

### Project Overview

Objective: Identify natural clusters and patterns in image data without using labels.

- Dataset: STL‑10
 (unlabeled subset)

Techniques Used:
- Feature extraction with PCA or pretrained CNNs
- Dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP)
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Outcome: Visualizations and cluster assignments to better understand image structure.
